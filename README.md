CupcakeComposed
===============

This is the composed version of the Cupcake app, which is part of the [Android Basics in Kotlin] course from Google, see [Unit 3] [Pathway 3] and the [Shared ViewModel Across Fragments] Codelab and the [Navigation and the back stack] Codelab. It shows how to incrementally introduce Compose by replacing Views in layout.xml with ComposeViews.

This app contains an order flow for cupcakes with options for quantity, flavor, and pickup date. The order details get displayed on an order summary screen and can be shared to another app to send the order.
